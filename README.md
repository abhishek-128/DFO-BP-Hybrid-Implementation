<i>Welcome to DFO BP: Implementation of Dispersive Flies Optimisation Backpropagation Hybrid to improve phishing websites detection.
A novel hybrid implementation of swarm intelligence algorithm and back-propagation.</i>

<h4>Preface</h4>

With numerous studies having employed multiple novel approaches to address the detection of phishing websites, this project employs a novel hybrid approach which attempts to work on the magnitude of the parameters and establish a foundation to describe the dependency of the neural network model with its parameter magnitudes.
It further evaluates the proposed novel hybrid approach by employing multiple metrics and compares it with past research to identify the grounds for improvements and establish its potential through an in-depth analysis of the model performance.
